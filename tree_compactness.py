On how to enumerate the partitions:
One way to solve the problem is to define a tree structure on these subgraphs as follows: choose an arbitrary assignment of distinct weights to the edges of the input graph. Define the parent of a connected induced subgraph to be the graph formed by finding its minimum spanning tree, removing the leaf edge of maximum weight, and forming the induced subgraph of the remaining vertices. For a subgraph with only one vertex, define its parent to be the empty graph (which forms the root of the tree structure)

Reverse search (essentially, DFS of this tree) will then find each connected induced subgraph in time polynomial per subgraph. You can find the children of any node in the tree by trying all ways of adding one vertex and checking which of them would form the heaviest leaf of the MST of the augmented subgraph; finding all the children of a single node takes polynomial time, which is all that's required to make this work.
